# quiz1 solution -- there are often many different for each problem
# I've left some "scaffolding" in place to show how I set up and/or verify my solutions

# 1.  Create a vector that contains 20 numbers. 
# (You may choose whatever numbers you like, 
# but make sure there are some duplicates.)

numVec <- c(1:8,7:14,7:10)
numVec

# 2. Use R to convert the vector from question 1 into a character vector.
charVec <- as.character(numVec)
charVec

# 3.  Use R to convert the vector from question 1 into a vector of factors.
numFactors <- as.factor(numVec)
numFactors

# 4.  Use R to show how many levels the vector in the previous question has.
nlevels(numFactors)

# alternative solution
length(unique(numFactors))

#5 Use R to create a vector that takes the vector from 
# question 1 and performs on it the formula 3x^2 - 4x + 1

numVec <- 3 * numVec ^ 2 - 4 * numVec + 1
numVec


#6. Create a named list. That is, create a list with several elements 
# that are each able to be referenced by name.

namedlist <- list(rank = 1:5, players = c("Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper"))

namedlist$players[2]

# 7. Create a data frame with four columns - one each character, 
# factor (with three levels), numeric, and date. 
# Your data frame should have at least 10 observations (rows).

# 8.  Illustrate how to add a row with a value for the factor column that isn't already in the list of levels.
# (Note: You do not need to accomplish this with a single line of code.)

# Task:  Add "West Side Story", "Musical", 10, "1961-1-1"

dfnew <- data.frame(title="West Side Story", genre="Musical", 
                  wins=10, release="1961-1-1")

# 9.  Show the code that would read in a CSV file called temperatures.csv 
#      from the current working directory.

#10.  Use a loop to calculate the final balance, rounded to the nearest cent, 
#      in an account that earns 3.24% interest compounded monthly after six years 
#      if the original balance is $1,500.

principal <- 1500
annual_interest_rate <- 0.0324 
compounding_periods_per_year <- 12
years <- 6

# loop below is less efficient than if we pre-calculated compounding_periods_per_year * years
#   and annual_interest_rate / compounding_periods_per_year
for (period in 1:(compounding_periods_per_year*years))
{
  principal <- principal + (principal * annual_interest_rate / compounding_periods_per_year)
}
print (principal)  # prints 1821.396
sprintf("%.2f", principal) #formats as 1821.40

# alternative: calculating interest without a loop

# 11.  Create a numeric vector of length 20 and 
# then write code to calculate the sum of every third element of the vector you have created.
nvect <- 1:20

nvect %% 3
nvect %% 3 == 0

sum(nvect)

sum(nvect[nvect %% 3 == 0])   # answer; prints 63

# alternative solution
nvect <- c(1:20)
sum(nvect[seq(0,length(nvect),3)])

# 12 Use a for loop to calculate sum of i = 1 to 10 of x^i  for the value x=2

x <- 2
sum <- 0
for (i in 1:10)
{
  sum <- sum + x ^ i
}
print (sum)

# 13.  Use a while loop to accomplish the same task as in the previous exercise.

x <- 2
sum <- 0
i <- 1
while (i <= 10)
{
  sum <- sum + x ^ i
  i <- i + 1
}
print (sum)

# 14.  Solve the problem from the previous two exercises without using a loop.

x <- 2
print(sum(x^(1:10)))

# an alternative solution: observe that this could also be written as 2 ^ (n+1) - 2

print(2^(10+1)-2)
